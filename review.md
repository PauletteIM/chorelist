# What you've done well

- all core requirements met:
  - Build it from “scratch”
  - Follow the design
  - Can’t add empty chore
  - Use: addEventListener(), innerHTML, template strings, localStorage
- stretch goals:
  - Can’t add existing chore
  - Click on individual chores to remove from list
  - Show a random GIF when all chores are completed
- showing a nice variety of JS methods to achive your goals: trim(), includes(), spliace(), indexOf()
- well commented JS file: easy to follow along

* camelCase and naming conventions OK

- HTML markup is well done and valid
- CSS is efficient; includes useful UX hover effects

# What could be improved

[] try not to rely on alert() to gove warnings: users don't like having to click extra buttons
=> use DOM warning messages instead and/or color hints
[] you probably realize that delete on click can be dangerous for the user. You will learn a way to add delete icons and handling these clicks in M5
[] input color should be darker than placeholder
